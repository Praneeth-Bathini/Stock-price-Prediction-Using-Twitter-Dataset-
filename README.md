Stock price prediction is a significant challenge in the financial domain, where accurate forecasting can offer substantial economic benefits. This project explores the potential of leveraging social media sentiment, specifically from Twitter, to predict stock price movements. Twitter has become a powerful platform where real-time opinions, news, and rumors are shared, often influencing the behavior of the financial markets. By analyzing the sentiment of tweets related to specific stocks, we aim to determine whether social media sentiment correlates with stock price fluctuations.
The project integrates two main datasets: historical stock price data and Twitter sentiment data. Stock prices are gathered from reliable financial sources, while tweets are collected using the Twitter API. Sentiment analysis techniques, such as natural language processing (NLP), are employed to classify tweets as positive, negative, or neutral. The combined dataset is then used to train machine learning models like linear regression, decision trees, or advanced algorithms like Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, to predict stock prices.
The results highlight the importance of social sentiment in stock market prediction, demonstrating how tweet sentiment can enhance the accuracy of traditional predictive models. Although stock prices are influenced by various factors beyond social media, the findings suggest that incorporating Twitter sentiment can improve the overall prediction accuracy, offering valuable insights for traders and investors. Future work may focus on integrating more features such as news data, trading volume, and financial indicators for further improvements.
